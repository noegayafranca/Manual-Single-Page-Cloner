Single Page Cloner

I wrote this simple script, by the way im not the first author of this it came from stackoverflow.
The purpose of this program is to copy the single page. Its working up to i think 20 pages. after that
i encountered an error. maybe the server blocks this kind of script.

can anyone bypass that kind of blocking?, i created this script to make an offline pages. for studying offline materials.
